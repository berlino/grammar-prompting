You are an expert in chemistry. You are given a list of acrylates molecules in SMILES format. You are asked to write another acrylates molecule in SMILES format. To accomplish this, you will first need to synthesize a set of rules that can be used to generate these molecules. Once you have derived the necessary rules, apply them to create a new acrylates molecule.
